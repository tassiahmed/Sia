The Bootstrapping Process
1. Announce ourselves as a participant to the bootstrap address
2. The bootstrap address finds an index for the new participant
3. The bootstrap address announces the new participant with its index to the quorum
4. Each participant adds the new participant to their state object
5. Each participant tells the new participant about themselves

Errors will happen if anyone tries to bootstrap after the first few seconds, this is not a secure procedure
